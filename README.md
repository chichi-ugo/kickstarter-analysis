# An Analysis of Kickstart Campaigns
Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This analysis is aimed to determine whether there are specifc factors that contribute to the success of a campaign and assist Louise in understanding the projection for her own crowdfunding campaign in order to set her up for her own success. 

With the initial analysis of the data, we were able to see that the parameters "Launch Date" and "Funding Goal" may have an impact, or indicaions, on the overall success of the campaign. The following is a summary of the results of looking at these parameter specifically.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We looked specifically at the category "Theater" campaigns data, as that was what most benefited our client Luise. We compared the "Launch Dates" of the compaigns over the years to their "Outcome" (whether they were successful, failed, or canceled) and looked specifically at each month to determine a trend. The "live" outcome was filtered out of the data, as it was not pertinent to the overall comparison.
